# App Programming H4, Mercantec Viborg

## Casper Pedersen, Data Technician specialized in programming

### Teacher: Mads Bock

#### This repo is for my course in app programming, it will take place at Mercantec in Viborg and lasts for 2 weeks

Assignment(In danish):
Du skal lave et projekt hvori du udvikler en app der afleveres i din portfolio l√∏bende. Du skal demonstrere at du kan implementere forskellige features. Det er med andre ord mindre vigtigt hvad din app handler om, men mere hvad den kan.

##### Product description

I will create a Flutter app for use with Bang & Olufsen products. The user should be able to:

* See a list of Bang & Olufsen devices discovered on current network :heavy_check_mark:
* Choose which devices he wants on his own list :heavy_check_mark:
* Customize the appearance of the app :heavy_check_mark: / Setting phone to darkmode will put App in darkmode. Might make appearance more customizable, if I'll have the time for it.

* Manage and create user profiles :x:
* Manage and create sound profiles :x:
* Control the devices :x:
* Update the devices :x:
* Assign sound profiles to user profiles :x:
* Group speakers by physical location :x:

A screen will be made for displaying and managing a list of all your devices. Clicking a product should display more information about the specific produt and it's physical location.
A screen will be made for managing users and their sound profiles.
A screen will be made for physical locations, so the user will be able to group it's devices wtihin the locations.(Kitchen, bedroom, living room, etc.)

Note that it will be pseudo product interactions, no real interations will be made with any products.

As I have zero experience in app programming, I will start off by doing some flutter tutorial(s), to get a feeling about how to handle it.
